𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 - Providing Insights for Crisis Recovery in an Online Food Delivery Startup

I’m excited to share my submission for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge, where I tackled a real-world business case: “Providing Insights for Crisis Recovery in an Online Food Delivery Startup”.

📌 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰

"QuickBite Express " is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup (founded in 2020) that connects customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens.
 In June 2025, "QuickBite" faced a major crisis. A viral social media incident involving food safety violations at partner restaurants, combined with a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season, triggered massive customer backlash. Competitors capitalized with aggressive campaigns, worsening the situation.


🔑 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬

- The crisis triggered a structural collapse in demand, with orders and revenue dropping sharply across all months post-June, confirming a non-seasonal disruption.
- Tier-1 metros like Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi faced nearly 70% order decline, making them the highest-risk markets for long-term customer loss.
- Delivery SLA failures emerged as the primary root cause of churn, with compliance falling to 12% and average delivery times increasing significantly.
- Negative customer sentiment peaked during early crisis months, driven by food quality, taste, packaging, and value-for-money concerns.
